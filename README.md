# DIAversity

The code uni**versity** for **D**eveloping **I**mmersive **A**pplications (**DIA**).

This project is currently ambitious in name only :) but we hope for it to grow into a collection of open-source learning resources for developing immersive applications.

Currently, it has one app: a VR head-mounted display (HMD) simulator that helps to interactively understand the optical and graphical concepts behind VR HMDs.

![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcddccde-f353-4098-9406-416448b85bfd)

One of the current motivations is to support the YouTube DIA series: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMKD6gDV_13-jVPNyDLUd4y6gSw0lMM-h&si=CZzlTOKfM5KPz5Ee

# Project Status

## Current Features
- Simulate a VR HMD's rendering of a scene in the two eye cameras
- Visualize the frustum of the eye cameras
- Adjust the HMD parameters (IPD, eye relief, lens-to-display distance, etc.)
- View how various calculated parameters (e.g., width/height of virtual image, FOVs, etc.) change as the HMD parameters change
- Switch scenes across primitive scenes and open source gaussian splats
- Toggle frustum visualization on/off
- Basic WASD + mouse camera movement

## Known Issues
- Flickering in gaussian splat scenes due to rendering multiple 3DGS rendered viewport (temporary fix: click 'HMD View' button to disable rendering of eye cameras)
- Large gaussian splats may not get cleared properly when rapidly switching scenes
- etc.

## Roadmap

### Short-term
- Fix critical bugs
- Add rendering of the virtual image planes

### Mid-term
- Add interaction mechanisms in VR

### Long-term
- Transition into a platform of multiple implementation-focused learning resources for developing immersive applications

# How to run

Just go to the live page built from the latest version that is served via GitHub pages: https://diaversity.org

### Some interesting things to try
- Increase the distLens2Display until it is greater than the focal length, f, of the lens. Something will flip...
- Increase the IPD until the frustum do not overlap anymore.
- Reduce the eyeRelief to see how the frustum changes.
- etc...

# How to build and run locally

## Prerequisites

This is a TypeScript project that uses npm for package management. You need to have Node.js installed to run npm. You can install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Steps

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into the cloned directory
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies as specified in `package.json`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` or the URL shown in the terminal if it is different

You can inspect the `package.json` file to see other available scripts.
- note that the `npm run build` script prepares the project for deployment on github pages

# Architecture

The application simply uses a 2-layer architecture: App and UI.

Draw UML diagram here:
```
 +-----------------+         +-----------------+
 |       App       | ---o)---|        UI       |
 +-----------------+         +-----------------+
   o
   |
   |
   |    +-----------------+
   -----|       HMD       |
   |    +-----------------+
   |
   |    +------------------+
   -----| FrustumVisualizer|
        +------------------+
```

The HMD class represents a VR headset's parameters and functionalities, including setup for simulated eye cameras and their projections.

The FrustumVisualizer class is used to visualize the frustum of a camera in the scene.

The App class is responsible for creating the scene and updating the scene based on the HMD.
- App owns the HMD and the FrustumVisualizer.
- App provides APIs for the UI to interact with the scene.

The UI class is responsible for handling user interactions and use the App to update the scene.
- UI knows about the App but App does not know about the UI.
